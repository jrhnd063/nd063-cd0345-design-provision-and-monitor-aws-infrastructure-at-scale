"To increase the resilience and performance with a budget of $20000, we can make the following changes:

* Switch to a mult-region setup to provide service even if an event affects `us-east-1`. Given the users are stated to be single-region, the alternative region should be close; `us-east-2` was selected as it should not provide appreciably different latency for Virginia region users. The new region contains a VPC with a multi-AZ, asynchronous read-replica of the Postgres database, plus the same setup as the primary region in terms of Web and Application servers.
* Increase database instance size and double the number of database read-replicas to alleviate read pressure on the database.
* Increase the number of constant EC2 Web and App servers from 4 to 6 and double the burst capacity available to their auto-scaling groups by increasing the number of 25% available instances from 4 to 8.",,,,,,,,,
